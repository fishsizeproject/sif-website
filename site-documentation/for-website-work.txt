These quarto extensions are required for the website to work so you will need to install them prior to making changes:
	quarto-ext/fontawesome
	jmgirard/embedpdf
	mcanouil/quarto-iconify
Install them via the 'quarto add' terminal command

Prior to publishing changes which include R code you might need to generate a new lockfile so your packages will work correctly. Make sure your packages are up to date and working in R, then run:
	renv::snapshot()

You can preview the site via the "Render" button in RStudio, however it will only show you the default language version (currently Lithuanian, or the lt profile). To preview the English version, use this command in the terminal:
  quarto preview --profiles en

You can also preview only one page with:
  quarto preview <path>/<filename>.qmd
  
I find that if you're changing hundreds of files at once RStudio can be extremely slow in its Git processes. Instead of using the Push, Pull and Commit buttons in RStudio, these terminal commands are much faster:
  git add --all
  git commit -m "Here's all the cool stuff I've done"
  git pull origin
  git push origin
  
If you're not currently on the main branch and you want to publish the site, you'll need to merge with main before pushing your changes. The easiest way to do this (after you've committed all changes) is from the terminal:
  git checkout main
  git pull
  git merge <your working branch>
  git push origin
