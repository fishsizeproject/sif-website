These quarto extensions are required for the website to work so you will need to install them prior to making changes:
	quarto-ext/fontawesome
	jmgirard/embedpdf
	mcanouil/quarto-iconify
Install them via the 'quarto add' terminal command

Prior to publishing changes which include R code you might need to generate a new lockfile so your packages will work correctly via:
	renv::snapshot()

Does shortcode work?
