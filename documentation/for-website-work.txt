These quarto extensions are required for the website to work so you will need to install them prior to making changes:
	quarto-ext/fontawesome
	jmgirard/embedpdf
	mcanouil/quarto-iconify
Install them via the 'quarto add' terminal command

Prior to publishing changes which include R code you might need to generate a new lockfile so your packages will work correctly via:
	renv::snapshot()

You can render and view the site via the "Render" button in RStudio, however it will only show you the default language version (currently English, or the en profile). To preview the Lithuanian version, use:
  quarto preview --profiles lt

You can also preview only one page with:
  quarto preview <path>/<filename>.qmd
