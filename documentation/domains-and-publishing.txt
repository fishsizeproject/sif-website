Requirements for publishing with gh-pages under a custom domain:

Repository settings: 	
	1. Under Pages -> Build and deployment, set Source = Deploy from a branch and branch = gh-pages -> root/ (must exist)
		Note: 	The process for first-time publishing detailed on the quarto help pages is wrong - using quarto publish gh-pages will throw a permissions error. 
				Instead, manually create the gh-pages branch with git checkout -b and then render the site with quarto render.
	2. Set Custom domain to the desired domain or subdomain name and check the Enforce HTTPS box.
	3. Repo name must be in the format <name>.github.io
			
DNS settings: 	
	1. Add the 4 "A" records pointing to github (values: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#dns-records-for-your-custom-domain)
	2. Add a CNAME record pointing to the correct repo name (<name>.github.io)
	
Project files:
	1. In the main branch root directory add a CNAME record with the correct domain/subdomain.
	2. Within the project yaml file, add:
		website:
			site-url: https://<domain/subdomain> 
			repo-url: https://github.com/<account>/<name>.github.io
		
Process for automatic live publishing on push to main:

Repository settings: 	
	1. Under Actions -> General -> Actions permissions, set to "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"

The publishing process is already set up. The action is detailed in the file ./github/workflows/publish.yml and should not need to be changed.
